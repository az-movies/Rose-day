          <span>My Love,</span>
          <br />
          On this Rose Day, each petal symbolizes my admiration <br />for you.
          Your presence colors my world with joy and warmth. Like a rose in full
          bloom, your beauty captivates my heart. The red roses reflect the
          passion that burns for you, while the white ones signify the purity of
          our love. In the garden of life, you're my most cherished blossom.
          Thank you for being my source of love and inspiration. Our journey
          together is as sweet as the fragrance of roses. Happy Rose Day, my
          love. Here's to many more petals of shared laughter and enduring love. 
          I remember every day the first shock we felt during our first date.
